Welcome to the site of [Tiago Becerra Paolini](https://github.com/tbpaolini) on GitHub!

Currently, this page is intentionally kept minimal. But a personal blog might be coming here at some point.

For the time being, here are the sites for my projects:
- [Spectrachroma](https://tbpaolini.github.io/spectrachroma): a software for calculating and plotting the color coordinates of emission spectra in the CIE 1931 Chromaticity Diagram (2 Degree Standard Observer).
- [imgconceal](https://tbpaolini.github.io/imgconceal): a steganography tool for hiding files inside JPEG and PNG images.
