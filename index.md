title: Tiago Paolini's projects

Welcome to the site of [Tiago Becerra Paolini](https://github.com/tbpaolini) on GitHub!

Currently, this page is intentionally kept minimal. But a personal blog might be coming here at some point.

For the time being, here are the sites for my projects:
- [Spectrachroma](https://tbpaolini.github.io/spectrachroma): a software for calculating and plotting the color coordinates of emission spectra in the CIE 1931 Chromaticity Diagram (2 Degree Standard Observer).
- [imgconceal](https://tbpaolini.github.io/imgconceal): a steganography tool for hiding files inside JPEG and PNG images.
- [Heartbound Save Editor](https://github.com/tbpaolini/Heartbound-Save-Editor): a graphical editor for the save files of the RPG game Heartbound.
- [Terminal Snake](https://github.com/tbpaolini/terminal-snake): the classical Snake game from old Nokia phones, but running in the terminal.
- [PyJpegDecoder](https://github.com/tbpaolini/PyJpegDecoder): a JPEG decoder written in Python, for helping people how the image format works internaly. It implements and explains both baseline scan and progressive scan, making it one of the few projects out there that has the progressive decoding shown in a readable way.
- [ChickenBot](https://github.com/tbpaolini/chickenbot): a Reddit bot who answers the ever elusive question of "Why did the chicken cross the road?".
- [OScar Bot](https://github.com/tbpaolini/gpt-2-oscar): a Twitch and YouTube both based on the GPT-2 language model, which was fine tuned with text from the game Heartbound. It lurks the chats of the game developer's streams (with his blessing) randomly replying to people with funny nonsensical stuff every now and then.
- [Subreddit Word Counter](https://github.com/tbpaolini/subreddit-wordcounter): counts how many times a term was said recently in a Reddit community.
